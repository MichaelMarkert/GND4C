# Custom CSS for Wikidata

Use with browser-addons like [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/) as I do in the demo. Feel free to tweak animation time and colors to your needs. Only issue so far is that you can edit existing statements but not add new ones when using this css (I did not manage to exclude the `+ add statement` link via css styling rules).
