# Custom CSS for Wikidata

The core idea is to clean up the Wikidata UI for a more easy reading experience and to accentuate properties that are important to individual users using CSS.

Use with browser-addons like [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/) as I do in the demo. Only issue so far is that you can edit existing statements but not add new ones when using this CSS (I did not manage to exclude the `+ add statement` link via css styling rules).
